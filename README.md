## Puppet Homedirs Module

[![Test Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pahoughton/puppet-homedirs.png?branch=devel)](https://travis-ci.org/pahoughton/puppet-homedirs)

Tiny puppet module that provides home_${user} directory facts according to /etc/password (i.e. home_root, home_postgresql

## Dependencies

See .fixtures.yml for the most accurate list

## Use - DO NOT!

Only test have been created so far.

Install the module. I recommend using .fixture.yml and [librarian-puppet](https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet) and providing the GitHub url: https://github.com/pahoughton/puppet-homedirs

then just refer to the facts as usual.
